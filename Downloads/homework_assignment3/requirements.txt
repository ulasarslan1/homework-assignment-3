Requirements:

Simultaneous Charging:
The system must be able to charge from 1 to N AGVs simultaneously. Charging capacity depends on available resources (charging stations).

Parallel Charging Simulation:
The test programme must simulate the parallel charging of AGVs at charging stations from 2 to N.

Random Arrival:
AGVs must arrive at the charging queue at random times. The arrival of each AGV must be simulated.

Queue Waiting Time:
The waiting time must be calculated for each AGV arriving at the queue. If the waiting time exceeds 15 minutes, the AGV should leave the queue.

Concurrent Task Execution:
The system should be able to execute M tasks simultaneously. These tasks can be independent processes (threads/tasks) simulating charging operations.

Resource Limitation:
Each task can only work with K AGVs; resource limitations must be taken into account.

Charging Completion:
AGVs whose charging process is complete should be removed from the system, and the vacated charging station should be available for another AGV.

Thread Safety / Concurrency Management:
Queues and charging stations should be safely usable by multiple tasks (thread-safe).

Performance:
The system must perform well when operating concurrently with M tasks and K AGVs. There must be no task conflicts or deadlocks.

Logging / Monitoring:
The times each AGV enters the queue, waits, and charges must be recorded.
